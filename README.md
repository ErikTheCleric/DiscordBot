# DiscordBot

This Discord bot (using your own TOKEN from your discord bot) relays different space quandaries like who is in space at the moment or the different types of objects and their quantities in space. This is all done through a variety of APIs, which pulls the information from the interface and reformat the data to be friendlier to Discord. There is also a unique "promotion" of roles: Whenever you ask a question you are promoted to a higher tier of role.

Future features to work on:
> More space links and APIs (perhaps more about planets and their facts)
> Pre-adding the roles into a server that are necessary for the promotions
